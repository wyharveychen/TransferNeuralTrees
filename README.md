You can download the data we use in the following link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/i87qac7kzkwy8d9/datasets.zip

Unzip it and put the folder /dataset under same directory of our code, and you can run Demo.m for the experiment.

Projected data would be recorded in /record_data, and you can use PlotProjectedData.R to visualize it.
